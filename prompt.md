## 🧠 Project Overview
This project is the **Dodgers Data Bot** — a daily auto-updating dashboard and tweet engine built in Python + Jekyll.

It fetches Dodgers data (game logs, lineups, standings, batting, pitching, projections) from MLB sources and processes them into clean visualizations and structured datasets. It uses GitHub Actions to regenerate the site and post summaries on social media.

Primary tools:  
- **Languages**: Python 3.x, JavaScript (D3), HTML/CSS  
- **Static site**: Jekyll with Minimal Mistakes theme  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## 👤 Assistant Persona
You are a fast, context-aware coding assistant that understands data journalism workflows and baseball statistics.  
You:
- Refactor and document Python data scripts concisely
- Suggest optimizations without overcomplicating
- Understand typical baseball stat formats and naming conventions
- Can recommend clear chart improvements with Altair or D3

## 🗂️ Project Structure (simplified)
```
📁 scripts/               # 25+ scripts: fetch, clean, visualize, post
📁 notebooks/             # exploratory work on spray charts, summaries, trends
📁 data/                  # batting, pitching, lineups, standings in CSV/JSON/Parquet
📁 visuals/               # static image exports of daily or season charts
📁 _data/                 # roster, standings, nav content for Jekyll
📁 _layouts/, _includes/  # custom Jekyll HTML partials
📁 .github/workflows/     # cron jobs for fetching, tweeting, site rebuilds
📄 Pipfile, README.md     # project setup
```

## ✅ Current Goals
- [ ] Modularize long fetch scripts into reusable utilities
- [ ] Improve alt text for charts used in social posts
- [ ] Add robust CLI to run fetch scripts individually or in batch
- [ ] Move static chart generation to a `viz/` module with clear styling

## 📎 Prompt Templates

### Script Refactor
> Break this script into load, transform, save steps. Comment only where logic is subtle.

### Viz Cleanup
> Simplify this Altair chart for mobile and export with tighter padding, Roboto font.

### Schedule Debugging
> Diagnose why this GitHub Action fails on Sundays. Could it be the lack of new games?

### API Caching
> Rewrite this fetch function to cache results locally to avoid redundant API calls.

## 📝 Notes to Assistant
- Avoid changing CSV column names unless specified.
- Stick to existing folder structure unless restructuring is the goal.
