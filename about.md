        <p>Dodgers Data Bot is an auto-updating dashboard that tracks how the Los Angeles Dodgers are doing — today and in the context of franchise history.</p>

        <p>Every day during the season, the bot pulls fresh stats from <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/">Baseball Savant</a> and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/">Baseball Reference</a> — standings, batting averages, and more — then turns them into clean, readable charts and tables that capture the story of the season.</p>

        <p>The goal? Make baseball data approachable. Show how the team is performing now, how it stacks up historically, and what might be coming next.</p>

        <h2 class="about-subhead">Why it exists</h2>

        <p>I'm <a href="https://mattstiles.me">Matt Stiles</a>, a Dodgers fan and <a href="https://github.com/stiles">hacker journalist</a> in Los Angeles. I built this because I love the team — and I enjoy bringing <a href="https://jacarandamap.com/">data to life</a>. A little insight makes every win more fun and every cold streak (slightly) easier to understand.</p>

        <h2 class="about-subhead">Join the conversation</h2>

        <p>I'd love to hear how you’re using this. <a href="https://github.com/stiles/dodgers">Check out the code</a>, follow <a href="https://x.com/DodgersDataBot">@DodgersDataBot</a>, or <a href="mailto:dodgersdatabot@gmail.com">drop a suggestion</a>.</p>
